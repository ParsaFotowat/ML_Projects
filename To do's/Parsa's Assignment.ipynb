    "## Arithmetic Expression Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics and computer science, arithmetic expressions are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers. These expressions can involve basic arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They are fundamental for calculations and solving various problems. Let's explore some common examples of arithmetic expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition is one of the basic arithmetic operations, used to find the sum of two or more numbers. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "2 + 3 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "10 + 15 + 5 = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtraction allows us to find the difference between two numbers. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "7 - 4 = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "20 - 10 = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplication is used to find the product of two or more numbers. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "5 * 4 = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "2 * 7 * 3 = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Division\n",
    "\n",
    "Division is used to find the quotient when one number is divided by another. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "10 / 2 = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "15 / 3 = 5\n"
